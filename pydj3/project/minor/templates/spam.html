  <p>Spam calls, spam messages, spam emails; this is a word we use too often but never really knew what it exactly meant. Whenever we see a red warning come up, we know its spam but do we really know why is it that we avoid it? Why do these spams occur, and why we get them so often in a day?</p>
  <p>This article will help you understand more about this term and related terms and how can take precautions against these activities.</p>
  <p>Coming to the question - what is spam? In simple words, spamming refers to activities being done in bulk amounts. Therefore, unwanted bulk messages delivered by email,
instant messaging, text messaging or other digital communication methods is known as spam. Since there are no operating expenses beyond managing email lists, typically, advertisers 
use it. Aditionally, it could occur on blogs, chat rooms, and more lately, over voice-over Internet conversations, for example, Zoom. Spam is also used to propogate viruses, and 
other malware as well as gather sensitive information from consumers.</p>
<p>A few of the different types of spam we find online - </p>
  <p><ul><li><strong> EMAIL SPAMS - </strong>Email spams are the most common type of spam. They clutter you inbox and distract you from reading mail that are actually important. Fortunately, you can filter, report or block majority of spam emails. Email spam frequently assumes many forms in an effort to elude any anti-spam software you might have set up. To do this, spammers look for ways to alter or disguise their messages, such as adding spaces between letters or swapping out important letters for numerals or other symbols, in order to avoid being caught by spam filters.Â  Even while your anti-spam software might not always be able to detect this, you should be able to do so pretty quickly. You could receive a barrage of unsolicited communications from spam that include obscene or improper explicit content. Spam could also include malware or be a "phishing" fraud</li></ul></p>
  <p><ul><li><strong> COMMENT/CONTENT SPAM - </strong>In addition to social networking platforms, spam is frequently seen in the comments sections of internet articles. These comments could just be advertisements, but they could also contain links to questionable or offensive websites. The majority of social media platforms, like Instagram, include warnings that "scammers utilise these phoney or compromised accounts to deceive you into handing them money or personal information." You should notify the platform if you see a comment that you believe to be spam. On the other hand,content spam is done in an effort to have their website pages appear higher in search results for prominent keywords and some spammers stuff their pages with them. Others may copy existing content without authorization in an effort to give their own pages a more significant and distinctive appearance.</li></ul></p>
  <p><ul><li><strong> TEXT MESSAGE SPAM - </strong>Text message spamming is almost the same as email spamming. The primary distinction is that spammers try to trick you via an instant messaging service like Facebook Messenger, Apple's iMessage, or SMS text messages rather than by inundating your email inbox. Although less frequent than email spam, IM/SMS spam is harder to avoid because no software exists to expressly filter spam sent through these platforms. Making a closed list of people from whom you accept instant messaging or blocking unknown phone numbers are effective ways to avoid the majority of it.</li></ul></p>
  <p><ul><li><strong> MALSPAM - </strong>Malspam, which stands for "malware spam" or "malicious spam," is a term for spam messages that include malware. Unaware readers who open an email attachment or click on a link get infected with malware such as ransomware, Trojans, bots, info-stealers, cryptominers, spyware, and keyloggers. Including harmful scripts in attachments of a known type, such as Word documents, PDF files, or PowerPoint presentations, is a popular distribution technique. The scripts start to run once the attachment is opened, retrieving the malware payload.</li></ul></p>
<p>Spam messages and emails are something we come across everyday. It is annoying but comes with serious consequences if meddled with. It may seem something that bombards your chat/mail box but in reality, is capable of infecting your systems with dangerous viruses. It is necessary to take steps such as blocking regular unknown numbers, adjusting your mail settings to only those authorised people you choose, etc.</p>
