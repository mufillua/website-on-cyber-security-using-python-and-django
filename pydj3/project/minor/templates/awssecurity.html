  <h3 class="w3-center">AWS SECURITY</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>A beginner's guide to AWS Security </em></p>
  
  <p>A huge range of qualities, features, and tools is referred to as AWS Security and is what makes Amazon Web Services so secure. It is one scalable and highly reliable cloud computing platform that helps to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of your system and data quickly. Their infrastructure is not only based on managing security best performances but also monitoring the unique needs of the cloud. It uses redundant and layered controls with continuous validation and testing and a sustainable amount of automation to make sure that the fundamental infrastructure is monitored and secured all the time. </p>
  <h3>Security of the AWS Infrastructure:</h3>
  <p>The infrastructure of AWS has been the most flexible and protected cloud computing environment in today’s world. The customers get resilient infrastructure that is designed for high security without the capital outlay and operational overhead of a traditional data center.  Installation of firewalls and encryption software is necessary for an on-premise configuration. In addition to the costs of operation on-site, such things might greatly increase costs.</p>
  <p>AWS appears to have an edge over the conventional setup due to the security mechanisms that are incorporated into the cloud infrastructure. Using network firewalls, connectivity choices, and DDoS (distributed denial of service) mitigation, AWS includes tools for enhancing privacy and restricting network access. For every piece of data that crosses AWS's worldwide network, automatic encryption is also in place. </p>
  <h3>Encryption of Data</h3>
  <p>AWS provides scalable and effective encryption solutions, giving you the option to add an extra layer of security to your cloud-based data that is at rest. • The majority of AWS services, including Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SageMaker, all offer data at rest encryption capabilities</p>
  <ul><li>Versatile key management options, such as AWS Key Management Service, that let you decide whether to let AWS maintain the encryption keys or give you full control over your own keys.</ul></li>
  <ul><li>Dedicated, hardware-based cryptographic key storage through the use of AWS CloudHSM, enabling you to assist in fulfilling your compliance obligations.</ul></li>
  <h3>Gains from Using AWS</h3>
  <p>Customers using AWS can benefit from a number of cloud security advantages, such as:</p>
  <ul><li>They have control over who can access their data and where it is stored. By combining access controls with ongoing monitoring, AWS made this possible. This guarantees that the appropriate resources always have the appropriate access.</ul></li>
  <ul><li>By automating security processes, human configuration errors can be decreased. Customers now have more time to devote to important responsibilities like expanding and improving their businesses.</ul></li>
  <ul><li>Using the technology and services provided by AWS-selected solution providers, extend the benefits of AWS security.</ul></li>
  <ul><li>In order to help clients satisfy security and compliance standards across industries like healthcare, finance, and others, AWS undergoes third-party examination to confirm that it complies with international compliance regulations. Additionally, AWS regularly analyses regulatory requirements.</ul></li>
  <h3>Logging and monitoring tools from AWS</h3>
  <p>Customers have access to what's going on within the Aws platform with the use of tools provided by AWS. Customers may immediately identify problems in this way, preventing problems from harming the company. Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty are a few examples of these products.</p>
  <h3>What is the AWS Security Process?</h3>
  <p>AWS is open to using a shared security responsibility model for operations. This configuration offers the adaptability and agility required to build security controls that are suitable for your company's needs. AWS is in charge of maintaining the physical security of data centers as well as the security of the hardware, virtualization technologies, and other components of its cloud architecture. However, customers remain in charge of the security of any workloads they put on the AWS infrastructure. For instance, they can provide loose limits on data intended for public use or restrict access to their sensitive data.</p>
  <p>While AWS uses best practices and a variety of security tools to ensure cloud security, keep in mind that it is a joint responsibility between AWS and you, the client.</p>
